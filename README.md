## Next Steps

- List of **migration tools** and a simple link
  - A list of ones that support current scenarios
  - A list of tools missing
    - Web Logic
    - DFS
    - AVS, Ryan
    - Kubernetes to AKS


# Notes

## Goals

- Get hardware footprint of on premises hyper V-based VM's
- Linux-based ASP.NET Container Apps (do discovery)
- Migrate Web-logic, Oracle Licensing Costs to AKS or App Services
  - Support tickets expensive
- Code to find information
- On prem
  - Custom cluster (firewall, multiple)

## Question

Can we help migrate from on prem web logic clusters to:
- AKS
- Azure Stack HCI AKS (why here)
    - Data Sovereignty laws

## Work Areas

- Azure Migrate has feature supporting to AVS Team
- What are 
Tools is a big landscape. 

## Web Logic
Java EE Support: WebLogic fully supports Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE), which is crucial for developing and deploying robust, large-scale applications.

Scalability and Performance: It offers high scalability and reliable performance, which is essential for handling large amounts of traffic and data in enterprise environments.

Clustering and Load Balancing: WebLogic provides advanced clustering capabilities, allowing multiple server instances to work together for better resource utilization and load balancing.

Security: Robust security features including SSL support, identity management, and secure transaction processing.

Integration with Oracle Products: As part of the Oracle ecosystem, WebLogic seamlessly integrates with other Oracle products like Oracle Database, increasing efficiency and reducing compatibility issues.

Administration and Management Tools: It offers powerful administration tools, both GUI and command-line, for managing applications and server instances.

Support for Various Standards and Protocols: WebLogic supports various web services standards, communication protocols, and interfaces, making it versatile for different application requirements.
